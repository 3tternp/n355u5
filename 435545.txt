# let's get curl (not installed by default on ubuntu 22.04) wget if fine but whatever
apt install curl
# download the deb package. note "17762" directory is likely specific to this exact nessus
version
# in the future just go to https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true and
find new versions to get url
curl -A Mozilla -o nessus.deb -k
"https://www.tenable.com/downloads/api/v2/pages/nessus/files/Nessus-10.7.3-debian10_amd64.deb" 
# install it
sudo dpkg -i nessus.deb
# we need to start nessus once for basic config before we can change preferences etc
service nessusd start
# visit the web interface (browsers choke on self-signed ssl just say accept)
# local linux box uses localhost like this, vps puts your vps ip (we'll change the default port later
if you don't let us yet)
https://127.0.01:8834/
# click "managed scanner" and continue
# select "tenable.sc" and continue
# set a username and password and remember it or write it down or have browser remember it
# ok now close the browser
# time to stop the service and do our update and crack
service nessusd stop 
# let's change the default port to something more obscure so we're not in shodan/censys/fuck-all
